very basic 2 name logins stem ( no gui )
hello, 
since im learning to code with Python, ive made this small project of small 2 name login code. 
this code doesnt allowes you to register your self ( yes if you edit code manually then you can add more names and password )
code is probably best for IOT secret doors. or any other as you just wanna add one time code ( change it manually in the code )
covers the concept of Flow control statements like if , elif and else and Loops like While loop. and also Break statements

you can copy the code :)
